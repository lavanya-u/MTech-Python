NUMPY - ( Numerical Python ) :
NumPy is a library for the Python programming language.
Supports large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
Mathematical functions are faster than list.
It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
The array object in NumPy is called ndarray.
Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important.
